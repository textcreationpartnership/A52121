THE DESCRIPTION Of a Plain INSTRUMENT, THAT With much eaſe and exactneſs will diſcover the ſituationboth elements of the dial instrument
#####Body#####

1. The Deſcription of a plain Instrument, that with much eaſe and exactneſs will diſcover the ſituation of any vertical plane howſoever inclining, reclining, or declining; and how to draw a Dyal upon any ſuch plane, or upon the face of any vertical body how irregular ſoever, together with ſeveral other things requiſite to the Art of Dyalling.

    _ The uſe of the aforeſaid Instrument.

      * 1. To draw an horizontal line,

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 2. To draw a perpendicular line

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 3. To draw a meridian line.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 4. To find the Suns Azimuth.

A caution.

      * 8, To find the declination of a Plane.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 9. To draw a true Dial ſpeedily, without skill in the Mathematicks, upon any erect plain, or irregular face of a body, being ſituate more Southerly, than the Eaſt or Weſt points, viz. when the Index ſhewes the declination.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 10. To draw a true Dyal ſpeedily upon any erect plane ſituated more Northerly than the Eaſt or Weſt point, viz. when the Counter-Index ſhews the declination.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 11. To draw a Meridian Dyal upon an Eaſt or Weſt plane.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.

      * 12. To draw an Horizontal Dyal upon its own plane.

A caution.

Here once for all note theſe 3 things

But here alſo it is good to note diverſe things.
